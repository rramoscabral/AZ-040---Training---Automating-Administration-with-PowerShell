## **Course Overview**

The Course '**AZ-040T00-A: Automating Administration with PowerShell**' is developed by the **Microsoft Learning** nd replace the retired Microsoft course **10961C: Automating Administration with Windows Powershell**.

This course provides students with the fundamental knowledge and skills to use PowerShell for administering and automating administration of Windows servers. 

This course provides students the skills to identify and build the command they require to perform a specific task. In addition, students learn how to build scripts to accomplish advanced tasks such as automating repetitive tasks and generating reports. 

This course provides prerequisite skills supporting a broad range of Microsoft products, including Windows Server, Windows Client, Microsoft Azure, and Microsoft 365. In keeping with that goal, this course will not focus on any one of those products, although Windows Server, which is the common platform for all of those products, will serve as the example for the techniques this course teaches.
